The soil was still damp from the morning rain, and the scent of mint and rosemary hung thick in the air. The children, now more confident, played near the herb beds, their laughter mingling with the low hum of adult conversation. A table made of salvaged wood held mugs of tea, a few notebooks, and a small clay pot of basil that had survived the storm. “We can’t just wait for someone else to fix this,” said Lila, a retired schoolteacher with silver-streaked hair and a voice like worn velvet. “The city took our park, but we can grow something new here.” She placed a hand on the cracked concrete beneath her, then looked around at the faces—so many familiar, so many tired. “What if we make this a place for everyone?

The air was thick with steam and the low hum of conversation. Then, the door creaked open, and Mayor Chen stepped inside, clutching a clipboard and glancing around nervously. “I didn’t think you’d still be here,” she said, voice cautious. “We’re here because we still have things to say,” replied Amina, the elder who’d led the first march.
